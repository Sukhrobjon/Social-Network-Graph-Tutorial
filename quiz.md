 ### Greedy Algorithms on Weighted Graphs: Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm
 - Describe greedy algorithms.
 - Give an example of a greedy algorithm (existing or one you make up) that doesn't give the optimal result.
  - Debug code that implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
  - Explain how Prim's algorithm  works, implement by hand, debug code.
  - Discuss how a priority queue speeds up Dijkstra's algorithm.


 ## Quiz 4
